This project is a mock-up an internal wholesale loan portal project.

Please download the zip file and open in Visual Studio, and set the initial start page to index.html.

Or, you can just copy all files outside of the zip file to your local IIS, and then navigate in your browser to:

http://[your localhost and port]/index.html

It is client only mock-up with no data or real functionality behind the scenes at this point.

Development Features I used for the mockup include:

1. Twitter Bootstrap
2. Nested Grid system within the normal 12 Grid system
3. Breadcrumbs
4. Jquery table sorter plugin
5. Pagination
